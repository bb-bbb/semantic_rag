The 2024–2026 global memory supply shortage is an ongoing period of supply constraints and rapid price escalation in the semiconductor memory market, particularly affecting DRAM and NAND flash memory. Unlike the 2020–2023 global chip shortage, which stemmed primarily from pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, this shortage is driven by a structural reallocation of manufacturing capacity toward high-margin products for artificial intelligence infrastructure, creating scarcity in consumer and enterprise PC markets.

Background
Following a severe market downturn in 2022–2023, major memory manufacturers—Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology—implemented strategic production cuts to stabilize pricing. By mid-2024, the rapid expansion of generative AI services triggered unprecedented demand for specialized memory products, particularly High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) used in AI accelerators and data center GPUs.
A 2024 McKinsey analysis projected that global demand for AI-ready data center capacity would grow at approximately 33% annually through 2030, with AI workloads consuming roughly 70% of total data center capacity by the decade's end.

Causes
HBM production displacement
HBM manufacturing requires significantly more wafer capacity per bit than standard DRAM modules. Industry sources reported that as manufacturers allocated increasing wafer capacity to HBM production to meet contracts with AI infrastructure providers, the supply of conventional DDR4 and DDR5 modules for consumer PCs and smartphones contracted sharply.

NAND flash capacity constraints
In the NAND flash segment, manufacturers prioritized higher-margin enterprise SSDs for data center applications while phasing out older process nodes more rapidly than anticipated. In November 2025, contract prices for NAND wafers increased by more than 60% month-over-month for certain product categories, with 512GB TLC experiencing the steepest rise as legacy manufacturing capacity was retired.

Impact on industry and consumers
Manufacturer responses
Major PC manufacturers responded to component cost increases with significant price adjustments and supply chain strategies. Dell Technologies Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke stated during a November 2025 analyst call that the company had "never witnessed costs escalating at the current pace," describing tighter availability across DRAM, hard drives, and NAND flash memory.
Lenovo Chief Financial Officer Winston Cheng described the cost surge as "unprecedented" and disclosed that the company's memory inventories were approximately 50% above normal levels in anticipation of further price increases.
Market research firm Counterpoint Research projected a 50% escalation in memory module prices by the second quarter of 2025.

Consumer electronics sector
The shortage particularly affected smartphone manufacturers and other consumer electronics producers. Chinese electronics firms including Xiaomi warned of impending price increases for mobile devices in 2026.
In Tokyo's Akihabara electronics district, retailers began limiting purchases of memory products to prevent hoarding, with prices for popular DDR5 memory modules more than doubling in some cases.

AI infrastructure competition
Technology companies including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms placed open-ended orders with memory suppliers, indicating they would accept as much supply as available regardless of cost, according to Reuters sources. In October 2025, OpenAI entered preliminary agreements with Samsung and SK Hynix for chip supplies for its Stargate project.
Nvidia, whose AI processors require substantial amounts of high-bandwidth memory, acknowledged significant price increases but stated it had secured adequate supply. CNBC reported that Nvidia's increasing adoption of LPDDR memory for its AI products added additional pressure to supply chains, as this memory type is also used in premium consumer electronics.
