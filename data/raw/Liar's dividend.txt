The Liar's Dividend is a political and media phenomenon in which public figures falsely claim that factual reporting is missing information, "fake news," or artificially generated in order to avoid accountability for their action   This concept has been studied in political science to understand how such claims can allow politicians to maintain public support following scandals or controversial statements. This tactic leverages public uncertainty about the accuracy of information and can mobilize parties and supporters. It often takes advantage of emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI)–generated content and deepfakes, which makes distinguishing authentic from manipulated material more difficult.

History
The rise of AI and deepfake technology has increased the ability to produce highly convincing, manipulated media, making it easier to mislead viewers. In September 2023, an audio clip of Michal Šimečka, a politician from the Progressive Slovakia party, circulated online, allegedly showing him discussing election manipulation with a journalist. A YouGov poll found that 85% of respondents were "very concerned" about the spread of misleading deepfakes. Deepfakes of U.S. presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump have also been widely circulated 
The term "Liar's Dividend" was coined by legal scholars Bobby Chesney and Danielle Citron to describe the phenomenon in which the existence of real deepfakes can make people skeptical of genuine information

Social Examples of the Liar's Dividend
Not all examples of the Liar's Dividend are political. Many incidents involving incriminating footage of civilians have been dismissed as AI-generated.

Tesla lawyers argued that Elon Musk's past statements about the safety of self-driving cars could not be used in court because they were alleged deepfakes (Thornhill, 2021).
In the aftermath of the January 6 Capitol riots, Guy Reffitt was charged with bringing a handgun to the Capitol building. His lawyer argued that evidence against him might be AI-generated, reflecting the use of the Liar's Dividend in legal contexts
