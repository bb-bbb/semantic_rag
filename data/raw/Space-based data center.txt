Space-based data centers or orbital AI infrastructure are proposed concepts to build AI data centers in the sun-synchronous orbit or other orbits utilizing space-based solar power.  Electric power has become the main bottleneck for terrestrial AI infrastructure. Building AI data centers in space off-the-grid could become cost competitive with advancements in reusable rockets.

History of space-based data center proposals and deployment
Early thinking about space-based computing infrastructure grew out of mid-20th-century visions for large orbital industrial systems, most notably proposals for space-based solar power, which were popularized in both technical literature and science writing by figures such as Isaac Asimov in the 1940s. These ideas emphasized exploiting the vacuum, continuous solar energy, and thermal characteristics of space to support power-intensive activities that would be difficult or inefficient on Earth.
In the 21st century, advances in small satellites, reusable launch vehicles, and high-performance computing revived interest in space-based data centers, with governments and private companies exploring orbital or near-space platforms for edge computing, secure data handling, and low-latency processing of Earth-observation data. In 2025, Starcloud deployed an NVIDIA H100-class system and became the first company to train an LLM in space and run a version of Google Gemini in space.

Advantages
Constant sunlight in the dawn/dusk sun-synchronous orbit
Solar irradiance is 36% higher in Earth orbit than on the surface
No weather storms or clouds
No property tax or land-use regulation
Saves space for other land use
Ample space for scalability
Won't strain the power grid
Radiative cooling in space reduces energy needed for thermal control

Disadvantages
High launch costs, particularly the launch cost
Solar hardware and computer hardware must survive launch, space assembly, radiation, microgravity, and orbital debris.
Kessler syndrome – runaway space debris
Maintenance and repair are difficult
Latency and bandwidth constrained
Limited life span of solar panels and electronics
Satellite flares could inhibit ground-based and space-based observational astronomy

Size and power generated
It would take ~1 square mile solar array in earth orbit to produce 1 gigawatt of power at 30% cell efficiency.
